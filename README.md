# Product Vision Statement 

Our goal is to create a smart, reactive calendar application that helps users organize events, manage budgets, and receive timely reminders without clutter or confusion. By integrating budgeting with scheduling, the app provides a single, clear view of time and money — making everyday planning effortless and efficient.
# Minutes for the Meeting

- Discussed and created the vision statement  
- Discussed PBI & Sprint Table  

### Issues with the program (using a student persona example)

1. **Overlapping Tasks and Calendar Conflicts:**  
   Users may schedule multiple tasks or events at the same time without realizing it.  
   Without a proper conflict-detection system, this can cause confusion and missed deadlines.

2. **Notification Overload or Missed Reminders:**  
   If reminders are too frequent, users might start ignoring or disabling them.  
   If they are too sparse or fail to trigger, users could miss important deadlines.

3. **Poor User Engagement / Task Abandonment:**  
   Users might stop using the app if the interface feels cluttered, unintuitive, or too time-consuming to add/manage tasks.  
   This can lead to abandoned to-do lists and reduced adoption of the app.
